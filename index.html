<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p align = "justify">Numerical functions are frequently used in scientific applications by linking to different vendor libraries. Choosing the most efficient library for a given application is essential for achieving good performance. The Performance Environment Autoconfiguration frameworK (PEAK) designed at the National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS) will help researchers determine the fastest library choices for their applications.
<p align = "justify">PEAK is capable of configuring the computational resources of Kraken, a Cray XT5 operated by NICS, by supporting three numerical vendor libraries as LibSci from Cray, ACML from AMD and MKL from Intel, built with different compilers (PGI, GNU and Intel).  

<h3><b>Website Options</b></h3><br>
<a style = "color:inherit" href="link.html"><h4>Find Compiling Options of the Programming Environment</h4></a>
<p align = "justify"> The Compiler Linking Tool is helpful for the users to set the compiling flags of the chosen compiler and the linking parameters of the numerical libraries. It is also a reference for the developers to transplant their codes to the supercomputers for compilation and execution.
<a style = "color:inherit" href="execute.html"><h4>Generate PBS Script for Environmental Configuration</h4></a>
<p align = "justify"> The Program Execution Tool helps users to configure the environmental variables on Kraken and Nautilus to take advantage of the system architecture. It provides a good example of PBS script for the first users to submit their jobs on supercomputers.
<a style = "color:inherit" href="generate.html"><h4>Generate Python Scripts by Custom Configuration</h4></a>
<p align = "justify"> Python scripts can be automatically generated for compiling an executing numerical function benchmarks based on custom configuration. As a user, you can choose different combinations of vendor libraries and compilers as well as the matrix size for the numerical functions. The python scripts needs to be uploaded to Kraken for execution.
<a style = "color:inherit" href="database.html"><h4>Check out Performance Data from Pre-Database</h4></a>
<p align = "justify"> A knowledge database is included by collecting the performance of 9 popular BLAS/LAPACK functions, with different vector and matrix sizes. The users are encouraged to query the website for suggestion on using a certain library with a certain compiler for better performance for their scientific applications.
